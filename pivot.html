            <p>well this is my introduction to javascript it is a programming language the brings web pages to life.<br/>
                when used on web page, its similar to wizard saying let there cool effects and more ways to make this html and css presentable
                but if that didnt make sense then just think of it as a lady putting on makeup.

        <section class="content" id="helloworld">
            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <p>hello world is like the first program every software developer starts with. Its not a must to start with but at most times 
                we do it to honor our principles
            </p>
            <img src="hello world.png">
            <p> And this is done in all languages like in that photo we have python. But am not sure about machine language its more like mars
                to me at the moment.</p>

        <section class="content" id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.            </p>

        <section class="content" id="declaring varaibles">
            <h2>Declaring varaibles</h2>
            <p>Before they are used, all variables have to be declared. Declaring a variable means defining its type, and optionally, setting an initial value (initializing the variable).<br/>Variables do not have to be initialized (assigned a value) when they are declared, but it is often useful.
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document.<br/> When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content" id="constants">
            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, constants are declared with const keyword and assigned at the time of the declaration. A constant can be global or local to a function where it is declared
                Constants are read-only, therefore you can not modify them later on.
