            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <p>hello world is like the first program every software developer starts with. Its not a must to start with but at most times 
                we do it to honor our principles
            </p>
            <img src="hello world.png">
            <p> And this is done in all languages like in that photo we have python. But am not sure about machine language its more like mars
                to me at the moment.</p>

        <section class="content" id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.            </p>
